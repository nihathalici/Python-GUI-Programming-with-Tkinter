# Python-GUI-Programming-with-Tkinter

This is my repo following the book "Python GUI Programming with Tkinter" by Alan D. Moore.

Synopsis taken from the book:
"This book aims to be much more than a reference manual for a particular GUI toolkit. As we walk through a fictitious workplace scenario, you will get a taste of what it's like to be an application programmer in a small office environment."
